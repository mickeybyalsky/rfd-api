A recreation to the RedFlagDeals experience, made for fun and to explore the world of REST API's.
<br>
Inspired by a few dabs at the real RFD by me and my friends, such as "How do I downvote a comment?", I said I can make it happen.
<br>
I've spent loads of hours on the site in the past year and scored some awsome deals myself. I wanted to learn about REST API's and wondered what better way to do it by trying to recreate a site I loved.
<br>
<br>
This RESTful API serves to recreate a fully functional backend of RedFlagDeals, by having users, posts, and comments and all the interaction that comes along with it, on a MongoDB mock database. 
<br>
Have some fun by creating a user, then creating a post or reading some posts, and maybe leave a comment on an exisiting post!
<br>
<br>
**Steps**: To use the endpoints, expand the dropdown of an endpoint, press "Try it out", fill in any fields if applicable and hit execute!
<br>
<br>
**Using Authorized Endpoints:**: You will first need to register a user, then use the authorize button to log into that user. Then you are all set to use all the endpoints!
<br>
<br>
<br>
Made with Python, FastAPI and MongoDB. Hosted on AWS EC2
